 I'm Matheus Ferreira, a Brazilian Software Developer passionate about learning new things and viewing the impact on people's life quality with things I create. I'm also, a student of Computer Science. Currently, my main stack tools are based on Javascript, Python and Ruby ecosystems, but now and then I code side-projects in other languages like Golang.
